West of House

You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.

There is a small mailbox here.

 

>open mailbox

Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet.

 

>read leaflet

(Taken)

"WELCOME TO ZORK!

 

ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning. In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortals. No computer should be without one!"

 

>drop leaflet

Dropped.

 

>go south

South of House

You are facing the south side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded.

 

>go east

Behind House

You are behind the white house. A path leads into the forest to the east. In one corner of the house there is a small window which is slightly ajar.

 

>open window

With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow entry.

 

>enter house

Kitchen

You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. A passage leads to the west and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. A dark chimney leads down and to the east is a small window which is open.

On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.

A bottle is sitting on the table.

The glass bottle contains:

  A quantity of water

 

>go west

Living Room

You are in the living room. There is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room.

Above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.

A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case.

 

>take lamp

Taken.

 

>move rug

With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the dusty cover of a closed trap door.

 

>open trap door

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into darkness.

 

>turn on lamp

The brass lantern is now on.

 

>go down

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

 

Cellar

You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading north, and a crawlway to the south. On the west is the bottom of a steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.

 

>go south

East of Chasm

You are on the east edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be seen. A narrow passage goes north, and the path you are on continues to the east.

 

>go east

Gallery

This is an art gallery. Most of the paintings have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste. The vandals left through either the north or west exits.

Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on the far wall is a painting of unparalleled beauty.

 

>take painting

Taken.

 

>go north

Studio

This appears to have been an artist's studio. The walls and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors. Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here. At the south end of the room is an open door (also covered with paint). A dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace; although you might be able to get up it, it seems unlikely you could get back down.

Loosely attached to a wall is a small piece of paper.

 

>go up chimney

Kitchen

On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.

A bottle is sitting on the table.

The glass bottle contains:

  A quantity of water

 

>go up

Attic

This is the attic. The only exit is a stairway leading down.

A large coil of rope is lying in the corner.

On a table is a nasty-looking knife.

 

>take knife

Taken.

 

>take rope

Taken.

 

>go down

Kitchen

On the table is an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers.

>open case

Opened.

 

>put painting inside case

Done.

 

>drop knife

Dropped.

 

>take sword

Taken.

 

>open trap door

The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into darkness.

 

>go down

The trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.

 

Cellar

Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.

 

>go north

The Troll Room

This is a small room with passages to the east and south and a forbidding hole leading west. Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.

A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages out of the room.

Your sword has begun to glow very brightly.

The troll's mighty blow drops you to your knees.

 

>kill troll with sword

You are still recovering from that last blow, so your attack is ineffective.

The troll's axe barely misses your ear.

 

>kill troll with sword

Clang! Crash! The troll parries.

The troll's axe barely misses your ear.

 

>kill troll with sword

The troll is confused and can't fight back.

The troll slowly regains his feet.

 

>kill troll with sword

The troll is knocked out!

 

>kill troll with sword

The unarmed troll cannot defend himself: He dies.

Almost as soon as the troll breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.

Your sword is no longer glowing.

 

>drop sword

Dropped.

 

>go east

East-West Passage

This is a narrow east-west passageway. There is a narrow stairway leading down at the north end of the room.

 

>go east

Round Room

This is a circular stone room with passages in all directions. Several of them have unfortunately been blocked by cave-ins.

 

>go southeast

Engravings Cave

You have entered a low cave with passages leading northwest and east.

There are old engravings on the walls here.

>go east

Dome Room

You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling of another room below. Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a wooden railing which circles the dome.

 

>tie rope to railing

The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.

 

>go down

Torch Room

This is a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down staircase. Above you is a large dome. Up around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing. In the center of the room sits a white marble pedestal.

A piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some five feet above your head.

Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.

 

>go south

Temple

This is the north end of a large temple. On the east wall is an ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language. Below the prayer is a staircase leading down. The west wall is solid granite. The exit to the north end of the room is through huge marble pillars.

There is a brass bell here.

 

>go east

Egyptian Room

This is a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb. There is an ascending staircase to the west.

The solid-gold coffin used for the burial of Ramses II is here.

 

>take coffin

Taken.

 

>go west

Temple

There is a brass bell here.

 

>go south

Altar

This is the south end of a large temple. In front of you is what appears to be an altar. In one corner is a small hole in the floor which leads into darkness. You probably could not get back up it.

On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.

On the altar is a large black book, open to page 569.

 

>pray

Forest

This is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there appears to be sunlight.

 

>turn off lamp

The brass lantern is now off.

 

>go south

Forest

This is a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.

 

>go north

Clearing

You are in a small clearing in a well marked forest path that extends to the east and west.

 

>go east

Canyon View

You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its west wall. From here there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream. Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs join the mighty ramparts of the Flathead Mountains to the east. Following the Canyon upstream to the north, Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. The mighty Frigid River flows out from a great dark cavern. To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around. A path leads northwest. It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.

 

>go down

Rocky Ledge

You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage which it is impossible for you to enter. Below you is the canyon bottom. Above you is more cliff, which appears climbable.

 

>go down

Canyon Bottom

You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable here. The lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls flows by below. To the north is a narrow path.

 

>go north

End of Rainbow

You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the Falls. The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs. The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the falls to the east and a narrow path continues to the southwest.

 

>drop coffin

Dropped.

 

>open coffin

The gold coffin opens.

A sceptre, possibly that of ancient Egypt itself, is in the coffin. The sceptre is ornamented with colored enamel, and tapers to a sharp point.

 

>take sceptre

Taken.

 

>wave sceptre

Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture, walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).

A shimmering pot of gold appears at the end of the rainbow.

 

>take gold

Taken.

 

>take coffin

Chasm

A chasm runs southwest to northeast and the path follows it. You are on the south side of the chasm, where a crack opens into a passage.

 

>go northeast

Reservoir South

You are in a long room on the south shore of a large lake, far too deep and wide for crossing.

There is a path along the stream to the east or west, a steep pathway climbing southwest along the edge of a chasm, and a path leading into a canyon to the southeast.

 

>go east

Dam

You are standing on the top of the Flood Control Dam #3, which was quite a tourist attraction in times far distant. There are paths to the north, south, and west, and a scramble down.

The sluice gates on the dam are closed. Behind the dam, there can be seen a wide reservoir. Water is pouring over the top of the now abandoned dam.

There is a control panel here, on which a large metal bolt is mounted. Directly above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.

 

>go north

Dam Lobby

This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring the dam. There are open doorways here to the north and east marked "Private", and there is a path leading south over the top of the dam.

Some guidebooks entitled "Flood Control Dam #3" are on the reception desk.

There is a matchbook whose cover says "Visit Beautiful FCD#3" here.

 

>take matches

Taken.

 

>go north

Maintenance Room

This is what appears to have been the maintenance room for Flood Control Dam #3. Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of the valuable equipment is gone. On the wall in front of you is a group of buttons colored blue, yellow, brown, and red. There are doorways to the west and south.

There is a group of tool chests here.

There is a wrench here.

There is an object which looks like a tube of toothpaste here.

Dropped.

 

>go south

Deep Canyon

You are on the south edge of a deep canyon. Passages lead off to the east, northwest and southwest. A stairway leads down. You can hear a loud roaring sound, like that of rushing water, from below.

 

>go down

Loud Room

This is a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from the ground. There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone stairway leading upward. The room is deafeningly loud with an undetermined rushing sound. The sound seems to reverberate from all of the walls, making it difficult even to think.

On the ground is a large platinum bar.

It is unbearably loud here, with an ear-splitting roar seeming to come from all around you. There is a pounding in your head which won't stop. With a tremendous effort, you scramble out of the room.

This is a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark, forbidding staircase leading down.

 

>go down

Entrance to Hades

You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed

 

  Abandon every hope all ye who enter here!

 

The gate is open; through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of mangled bodies in one corner. Thousands of voices, lamenting some hideous fate, can be heard.

The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your attempts to pass.

 

>ring bell

The bell suddenly becomes red hot and falls to the ground. The wraiths, as if paralyzed, stop their jeering and slowly turn to face you. On their ashen faces, the expression of a long-forgotten terror takes shape.

In your confusion, the candles drop to the ground (and they are out).

 

>take candles

Taken.

 

>light match

One of the matches starts to burn.

 

>light candles with match

The candles are lit.

The flames flicker wildly and appear to dance. The earth beneath your feet trembles, and your legs nearly buckle beneath you. The spirits cower at your unearthly power.

The match has gone out.

 

>read book

Each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening confusion. As the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding, speaks: "Begone, fiends!" A heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, and the spirits, sensing a greater power, flee through the walls.

 

>drop book

Dropped.

 

>go south

Land of the Dead

You have entered the Land of the Living Dead. Thousands of lost souls can be heard weeping and moaning. In the corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous adventurers less fortunate than yourself. A passage exits to the north.

Lying in one corner of the room is a beautifully carved crystal skull. It appears to be grinning at you rather nastily.

 

>take skull

>go north

Cold Passage

This is a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway turns into a southward path.

 

>go west

Slide Room

This is a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a coal mine. On the south wall of the chamber the letters "Granite Wall" are etched in the rock. To the east is a long passage, and there is a steep metal slide twisting downward. To the north is a small opening.

 

>go north

Mine Entrance

You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal mine. The shaft enters the west wall, and there is another exit on the south end of the room.

Shore

You are on the east shore of the river. The water here seems somewhat treacherous. A path travels from north to south here, the south end quickly turning around a sharp corner.

North of House

You are facing the north side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are boarded up. To the north a narrow path winds through the trees.

 

>go north

Forest Path

This is a path winding through a dimly lit forest. The path heads north-south here. One particularly large tree with some low branches stands at the edge of the path.

 

>climb tree

Up a Tree

You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches. The nearest branch above you is above your reach.

Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.

In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl. Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and closed with a delicate looking clasp. The egg appears extremely fragile.

Cyclops Room

This room has an exit on the northwest, and a staircase leading up.

A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere adventurers), blocks the staircase. From his state of health, and the bloodstains on the walls, you gather that he is not very friendly, though he likes people.

 

>Ulysses

The cyclops, hearing the name of his father's deadly nemesis, flees the room by knocking down the wall on the east of the room.

 

Treasure Room

This is a large room, whose east wall is solid granite. A number of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about on the floor. There is an exit down a staircase.

There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning against one wall. He is armed with a deadly stiletto.

There is a silver chalice, intricately engraved, here.

The thief attacks, and you fall back desperately.

 

>give egg to thief

The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity, but accepts the jewel-encrusted egg and stops to admire its beauty.

 

>go down

>go east

Strange Passage

This is a long passage. To the west is one entrance. On the east there is an old wooden door, with a large opening in it (about cyclops sized).

Strange Passage

 

>go west

Cyclops Room

 

>go up

You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway. Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.

The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room suddenly vanish.

 

Treasure Room

There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a large bag, leaning against one wall. He is armed with a deadly stiletto.

There is a silver chalice, intricately engraved, here.

You dodge as the thief comes in low.

 

>kill thief with knife

The thief is disarmed by a subtle feint past his guard.

The robber, somewhat surprised at this turn of events, nimbly retrieves his stiletto.

 

>kill thief with knife

You dodge as the thief comes in low.

 

>kill thief with knife

It's curtains for the thief as your nasty knife removes his head.

Almost as soon as the thief breathes his last breath, a cloud of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the carcass has disappeared.

As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his treasures reappear:

  A stiletto

  A jewel-encrusted egg, with a golden clockwork canary

  A torch

  A crystal skull

  A sapphire-encrusted bracelet

The chalice is now safe to take.

Grating Room

You are in a small room near the maze. There are twisty passages in the immediate vicinity.

Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.

The grate is unlocked.

 

>open grate

The grating opens to reveal trees above you.

A pile of leaves falls onto your head and to the ground.

You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on all sides. A path leads south.

There is an open grating, descending into darkness.

>climb tree

Up a Tree

Beside you on the branch is a small bird's nest.

You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.

 

>wind up canary

The canary chirps, slightly off-key, an aria from a forgotten opera. From out of the greenery flies a lovely songbird. It perches on a limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing. As it does so a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass. As the canary winds down, the songbird flies away.

 

>go down

Loud Room

This is a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from the ground. There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone stairway leading upward. The room is deafeningly loud with an undetermined rushing sound. The sound seems to reverberate from all of the walls, making it difficult even to think.

On the ground is a large platinum bar.
